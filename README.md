# PasswordManagerMx

A simple C# password manager application. The application stores a list of accounts, each account contains information like account name, email, user name, password, and other miscellaneous information. This application allows the user to add, edit, and remove accounts. Account information is stored and encrypted in the EncryptedPasswordList.txt. The user can send the encrypted file and decrypt it with PasswordManagerMx. The encryption is basically just an enigma machine on steroids, so keep that in mind if you really care about security. The EncryptedPasswordList.txt can also be exported as plain text from the *file* menu.
